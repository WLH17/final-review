## Planning Projects
Planning your personal projects is an especially important part of the project building process. When planning you should consider:
* Your applications MVP (minimum viable product)
* The data your application works with
* Your database schema
* Wireframes for your application views
* Endpoints

Don't get caught up in the 'feature fairy'. Focus on your MVP first, and then with any extra time, work on adding bonus features to your application.
